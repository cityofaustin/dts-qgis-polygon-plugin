## Background

The Vision Zero team, as part of the Austin Transportation and Public Works Department, operates a database of crashes in and around the Austin city limits. These's crashes are tracked by a point position, and in an effort to conduct analysis of the city's roadways in relation to crash location and crash severity, a set of polygons was created based on the street network. These polygons are of approximate equal area and have are formed in such a way that intersections are built into a single shape and interconnecting roads between intersections are divided into equal segments. By aggregating crashes into these polygons, comparisons become possible between intersections and road segments.
